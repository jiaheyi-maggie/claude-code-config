name: route
description: Decision router — tells you exactly which command, agent, or skill to use for your current task. Use when unsure what tool to reach for, or say "/route" to get a recommendation.
---

You are a routing engine for the Claude Code ecosystem. The user has described what they want to do (or you can infer it from context). Your job is to recommend the **exact** command, agent, or skill — not explain what's available, but tell them what to run RIGHT NOW.

If $ARGUMENTS is provided, route based on that description. If not, infer from the current conversation context.

## Decision tree

### "I have an idea / want to build something new"
- **Greenfield product idea?** → `/ideate` + spawn `product-manager` agent
- **New feature inside an existing project?** → `/explore-feature <description>` (reads codebase, maps against existing architecture, proposes scoped approach)
- **Need UI/UX direction?** → spawn `ux-engineer` agent
- **Ready to lock requirements?** → `/create-prd` + spawn `product-manager` agent

### "I need to design the system"
- **Architecture review with diagrams?** → `/architect` (generates interactive HTML)
- **Deep tech selection / system design?** → spawn `senior-engineer` agent
- **Need to research unfamiliar tech first?** → `/research` (invokes docs-researcher)
- **Complex multi-domain project?** → spawn `chief-architect` agent
- **Create implementation plan?** → `/plan` (surgical, reversible blueprint)

### "I need to design the UI"
- **User flows, wireframes, interaction patterns?** → spawn `ux-engineer` agent
- **Component architecture, state management?** → spawn `frontend-engineer` agent
- **Both (full design phase)?** → spawn `ux-engineer` + `frontend-engineer` in parallel

### "I have a list of features to build"
- **Multiple features, need orchestration?** → `/build-features <list>` (DAG analysis, parallel agents, quality gates)
- **Single feature?** → `/explore-feature` → `/plan` → build (don't need orchestration)

### "I'm ready to write code"
- **Starting a new session?** → `/prime` first (loads project context)
- **Test-driven development?** → `/tdd` (strict Red-Green-Refactor)
- **Backend / systems / API work?** → spawn `senior-engineer` agent
- **Frontend / React / Next.js?** → spawn `frontend-engineer` agent
- **Full pipeline (research → plan → build)?** → `/workflow` (one command, orchestrated)
- **Execute an existing plan?** → `/implement` (3 self-correction retries)
- **New project from scratch?** → `scaffold` skill + `/prime`

### "Implementation is done but not quite right"
- **Features have bugs or don't match the spec?** → spawn `qa-engineer` agent (verifies every feature against requirements, fixes bugs, iterates)
- **Want tweaks after seeing the result?** → spawn `qa-engineer` agent (accepts refinements in a loop until you're satisfied)
- **`/review-feature` keeps finding issues?** → spawn `qa-engineer` agent (it fixes them, not just reports)
- **Single known bug?** → `/bugfix <description>` (lighter weight, tracks attempts)

### "Something is broken"
- **Known bug, need structured fix?** → `/bugfix <description>` (tracks attempts in .claude/bugs.md)
- **Mysterious error or test failure?** → `debug-issue` skill (systematic workflow)
- **C / memory / segfault / perf?** → spawn `systems-debugger` agent
- **Complex system failure?** → spawn `brahma-investigator` agent (root cause analysis)
- **Need to profile performance?** → `profile-code` skill (Python cProfile / C perf)

### "I need to review code"
- **Just finished a big feature?** → spawn `code-reviewer` agent (auto 4-pass review)
- **Manual feature review?** → `/review-feature` (bugs, logic, quality, product alignment)
- **Security-focused audit?** → `/security-audit` + spawn `security-reviewer` agent
- **PR review on GitHub?** → `review-pr` skill
- **Cross-artifact consistency check?** → spawn `brahma-analyzer` agent

### "I need documentation"
- **API docs, ADRs, changelogs, READMEs?** → spawn `tech-writer` agent
- **Explain existing code to someone?** → `explain-code` skill (visual diagrams + analogies)
- **Research external library docs?** → `/research` (invokes docs-researcher)

### "I'm ready to ship"
- **Final quality check?** → `/pre-ship` (7 gates, all must pass)
- **Production deployment?** → spawn `brahma-deployer` agent (canary + auto-rollback)
- **Set up monitoring?** → spawn `brahma-monitor` agent (metrics, logs, traces)
- **Performance / scaling concerns?** → spawn `brahma-optimizer` agent

### "Session management"
- **Stepping away?** → `/tbc` (bookmark) — then `/catch-up` when back
- **End of session?** → `/handover` (saves state for next session)
- **What did I do last week?** → `/summarize <topic>` (searches past sessions)
- **Context getting bloated?** → `/context` + `context-engineering` skill
- **Need multi-agent parallelism?** → `/launch-multiagent-team` (decision framework)
- **Want to expand a rough prompt?** → `/generate-prompt`

## How to respond

Analyze the task and recommend the **optimal toolchain** — sometimes that's a single command, sometimes it's a sequenced combination, sometimes it's parallel agents. Figure it out from context.

### Single tool is enough when:
- The task maps cleanly to one command (e.g., "fix this bug" → `/bugfix`)
- It's a session management action (e.g., "stepping away" → `/tbc`)
- A single agent covers the full scope (e.g., "write API docs" → `tech-writer` agent)

### Recommend a combination when:
- The task spans multiple phases (e.g., "build a new feature" → `/research` → `/plan` → `/implement`, or just `/workflow`)
- Different expertise is needed (e.g., "design and build a dashboard" → `ux-engineer` for flows + `frontend-engineer` for implementation)
- Quality gates apply (e.g., "finish and ship" → `code-reviewer` agent → `/security-audit` → `/pre-ship`)
- Parallel work is possible (e.g., `ux-engineer` || `frontend-engineer` for design, `tech-writer` || `code-reviewer` post-build)

### Format:
- Lead with the recommendation, not the reasoning
- For single tools: **"Use `/bugfix <desc>`"** — one line, done
- For combinations: show the sequence with arrows or parallel notation
  ```
  /research Redis caching → /plan → /implement
  ```
  ```
  parallel: ux-engineer (user flows) + frontend-engineer (component arch)
  then: senior-engineer (backend API)
  then: code-reviewer
  ```
- Keep it concise — the user wants a routing decision, not a lecture
- If the choice genuinely depends on a detail you don't know, ask that one specific question
